Project Six Title: Machine Learning for Identification of REE-CM Hot Zones Term: Summer 2025 Location: on-site or remote Required Skills: Machine Learning Abstract: Characterization of Rare Earth Elements and Critical Minerals (REE-CM) in unconventional and secondary sources is a complex task that needs to overcome the challenges of detecting low and variable concentrations and the uniqueness of every source material deposit in terms of composition, host material, and disposal environment. We propose a machine learning (ML)-aided multi-physics approach for rapid identification and characterization of REE-CM hot zones in mine tailings for efficient recovery with a focus on coal and sulfide mine tailings and other processing or utilization byproducts, such as fly ash and refuse deposits. This multi-physics approach integrates a range of geophysical, radiological, and optical technologies deployed on aerial and surface platforms suitable for REE-CM prospecting. This approach provides a cross scale capability from whole tailing REE-CM hot zone identification to mineralogical and REE-CM characterization and quantification. Advanced ML capabilities are key to integrate these multi-physics datasets for identifying hot zones and optimizing sensing technology deployment. Feature engineering ML jointed with federated learning and transfer learning will be used for data organization, feature extraction and privacy protection.  Project Seven Title: Time Series Analysis of Network Utilization for Distributed Scientific Workflows Term: Summer 2025 Location: flexible, prefer onsite Required Skills: python, machine learning, data analysis Abstract: Large-scale scientific projects and simulations generate massive amounts of data, which are then transferred to scientific clusters for analysis. This process involves thousands of concurrent data movements and accesses, resulting in redundant transfers and increased network traffic. A regional caching strategy can mitigate this issue by sharing data among users and sites, reducing latency, and improving overall application performance. This project aims to:  1. Explore various time series analysis methods to develop a robust model for network utilization data. 2. Design multi-variate, multi-step time series mechanisms, including machine learning approaches, to capture complex patterns and trends. 3. Discover insights about network utilization trends, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize caching strategies and improve network performance.  Project Eight Title: Analyzing Dataset Popularity for Optimizing In-network Storage Term: Summer 2025 Location: flexible, prefer onsite Required Skills: python, machine learning, data analysis Abstract: Scientific computing has seen a surge in large data transfers. Many of these transfers are redundant, with users repeatedly accessing the same data files for debugging or collaborating on related research topics. To mitigate this, regional data caches have been designed to reduce network traffic and latency, ultimately improving application performance. This project aims to investigate the popularity of datasets in regional data caches, with a focus on determining the predictability of data access patterns. We seek to inform the development of caching policies that can optimize network utilization. Our goal is to answer key questions such as: Which datasets are most frequently accessed? Can we identify patterns in data access behavior? And how can we leverage this knowledge to improve caching strategies?  Project Nine Title: Predicting Laser Component Failures in Network Routers for Proactive Maintenance Term: Summer 2025 Location: flexible, prefer onsite Required Skills: python, machine learning, data analysis Abstract: High-speed network routers and switches rely on lasers for data transmission, and unexpected failures can have significant impacts on network connectivity. We aim to develop a predictive maintenance tool that can identify potential laser component failures before they occur. Using digital monitoring data from ESnet core routers, this project will apply analysis algorithms for feature extraction and failure prediction. Our goal is to identify a reliable algorithm that can predict failure events with sufficient lead time, enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing network disruptions. Initial evaluation of the existing monitoring data has already revealed opportunities for improving the data collection process, and this project will continue to explore and refine the dataset. By developing a usable tool for the network operations center, we can validate the effectiveness of our approach and improve network reliability.

Expected Salary Range: $70,000 – $120,000/year Apply Now – Client Solutions Analyst (Remote) Client Solutions Analyst Job Responsibilities If you read our job posting and thought, “That sounds great, but what is this job actually like?”, then keep reading! The core function of our role at Grant Street Group is to be a liaison between our developers and our clients, and this requires us to wear many different hats. So what do all of these “hats” really mean? Problem Solving: Every day you work to solve complex problems. When you analyze a calculation, investigate the cause of a bug, or propose a new process you are venturing into unfamiliar territory to find a solution. Our clients and developers rely on your problem solving skills to ensure our software is built and supported effectively. Client support: When a customer has a question, problem, or suggestion, they come to you! You are known as a subject matter expert and our clients rely on that expertise regularly. Whether the issue is major or minor, you know that Grant Street Group takes Software as a Service literally. Prioritization: Our software is ever-changing. With that comes the need to prioritize what, when, and how changes are made. Since you’re working with the software and our clients daily, who better to prioritize than you? Client solutions analysts are constantly asking themselves: Does this feature need to be completed before a certain time? What is the impact of this bug? How can other clients benefit from this change? We use a ticketing system to track pieces of work such as functionality requests and bug fixes. We then prioritize them for developers to work on. Technical Specifications: It’s your job to convey to the developers what changes need to be made. What happens when you click this button? What does the page look like? How is this file transferred to an external system? In this way, you are directly affecting the product and our clients’ experience. Testing: When a developer completes a change, you get to test it out (in a beta environment) to ensure that it’s working correctly. Does the new behavior match the specification? Does everything else surrounding the change still work correctly? Implementations: We’re a growing company and adding new clients is an exciting part of that growth! Since you’re a subject matter expert, you coordinate with new clients to configure the software to best fit their needs. Think of yourself as a consultant. What business processes does the client need to accomplish? How can our software fit in with and help that process? Training: Helping clients learn about how our software works is also part of your role. Whether it’s a new client coming up to speed on how tasks are completed, or an existing client that is incorporating a new feature into their process, you’re a resource for providing the information and tools they need. Does this sound exciting and overwhelming at the same time? Most of us thought so too. If you haven’t had experience in this area before, know that many of us lacked client solutions analyst experience before we came to Grant Street Group. What we did have was intellectual curiosity and a passion for problem solving. If you’ve already had client solutions analyst experience, that’s great, and we’re excited about the possibility of you continuing on that path with us. So now that you know what we do, why are you a great fit? You’ve probably spent a large majority of your life asking “Why” and then making sure that you figure out the answer. You love using all parts of your brain equally, and the thought of speaking with a client or learning about a database schema equally intrigues you. You’re the one that people rely on in team projects. You’re always itching to know more and you hold yourself and others to a high standard. Before you begin the interview process, keep in mind that we have a tendency to pay special attention to those that put in extra effort in their applications. We are radical proponents of the belief that you are more than just a resume. If you’re excited about this opportunity, we can’t wait to get to know you!

Requisition code: 201633', 'Remote Organizational Overview The Dignity Restoration Project (DRP) is a pioneering initiative operating at the nexus of racial justice and economic equity. It seeks to rectify the profound injustices inflicted upon Detroit homeowners—predominantly African-American families—during the city’s property tax foreclosure crisis from 2009 to 2015. Over this period, unlawful over taxation, amounting to approximately $600 million, stripped more than 30,000 families of their homes and deepened America’s already staggering racial wealth gap. DRP is dedicated not only to securing financial restitution for the victims, but also to restoring dignity to those affected through comprehensive social and economic solutions. This initiative also aims to develop a scalable model for reparations with national significance. Co-founded by Bernadette Atuahene, Esq., a respected law professor, Detroit resident, and fierce advocate for economic justice, DRP introduced the concept of “dignity restoration” as its guiding principle. This concept extends beyond financial compensation, acknowledging the deep psychological and emotional harm caused by the loss of property and its impact on personal dignity and agency. Professor Atuahene, a thought leader in this field, further explored the illegal tax foreclosure crisis in her New York Times Op-Ed, Scandal of a Predatory City. Partnerships Research: In partnership with Stanford University SPARQ, an esteemed behavioral science research center, we are designing a rigorous impact evaluation to understand the factors shaping public perceptions of reparations. This pioneering study on racial bias and inequality utilizes advanced social science research methodologies and is guided by a team of five skilled Principal Investigators: Dr. Catherine Thomas, Dr. Hazel Markus, New York Times Author of Biased, Dr. Jennifer Eberhardt, Dr. MarYam Hamedani, and Dr. Sara Constantin. Fund Manager: UpTogether serves as the fund manager for DRP, reflecting a commitment to redefining poverty alleviation strategies. As a systems-change organization, UpTogether seeks to reshape policies, systems, and societal attitudes by investing in the inherent strengths of individuals across the United States. Their partnership with DRP ensures that funds are managed efficiently while empowering recipients, fostering autonomy, and promoting economic and social mobility within affected communities. Incubator: DRP is incubated at the Global Development Incubator, which provides a comprehensive support framework designed to accelerate the impact of innovative projects globally. GDI’s extensive track record of success, including raising over $724 million in capital, highlights their dedication to nurturing and scaling initiatives that address systemic issues and promote inclusive global development. Funders: The DRP is supported by a network of prestigious funders, including the Ford Foundation, the McGregor Foundation, the Compton Foundation, Global Development Incubator, Panorama Global, and the Hudson Webber Foundation.

The day-to-day challenges of work and life will be unique to you but our commitment to helping you find a balance will never vary. From the GO At Play’n GO our purpose is to entertain.

Are you ready to help us face challenges and find solutions that get us both to the next level of excellence?  What the role entails: Some of the key responsibilities of our Generative AI Solution Engineer will be: Data collection and preprocessing Identify all data sources required by the system, including documents, databases, web pages etc Define data requirements for data engineers who will set up the proper data pipelines (including using Bedrock’s action groups or function calling to fetch real-time data). Ensure the data is clean and free from errors and irrelevant information. Enrich data with enough background information for the LLMs to learn. Ensure proper semantic representations of (numeric) tables, so an LLM can \"see\" the structure – e.g., use models such as Amazon Textract to turn tabular data into semantic HTML or Markdown format that LLMs can understand. Further consider extra representation engineering if dealing with long tables to help extract the correct semantic structure for LLMs. Extract meta data when needed – e.g., based on LLMs or regex-based custom code. Data chunking: Consider the nature of the data (e.g., structured, semi-structured or unstructured; whether tabular; whether numeric), use case requirements (whether precise answer is required) and system performance (quality vs. speed vs. running cost). Then choose the best chunking approach (e.g., semantic chunking, fixed-length chunking, sliding window chunking, hierarchical chunking, chunking based on custom code etc.) accordingly. Creating and storing knowledge embeddings: Explore different embedding models (e.g., AWS Titan variants) on Bedrock and select the best performing one. Work with DB engineer to choose the right DB (e.g., Amazon OpenSearch, Kendra, Pinecone or Aurora) to store the knowledge embeddings, judging by the trade-off between quality, speed and running cost. User queries processing: Figure out how to best transform the queries prior to retrieval – such as customizing Bedrock’s default prompt template for guided query decomposition, and making use of simple LLMs to ask user for missing information if needed via customizing the prompt template for example. Query embedding and information retrieving: Convert transformed queries into an embedding using the same model as in the knowledge embedding step. Then retrieve the most relevant vectorized knowledge chunks, based on similarity search. Filter on metadata if needed. Post-retrieval processing: Figure out how to best use simple summarizing LLMs and third-party ranking models (e.g., bge-reranker-large from Hugging Face) to summarize or re-rank the retrieved information. Generating Responses: Feed the combined queries and information chunks to LLMs, to generate the right response – the GenAI engineer needs to choose the best generative LLM (AWS Titan models, Antropic Claude models, Jurassic and Jamba models, Meta Llama models, or Mistral models etc.) from Bedrock based on the manual documentation and experimentation. Implement the mathematical aggregation (via arithmetic) of multiple cells required by data analysis via AWS Bedrock’s action groups or function calling (set up as a dedicated calculator tool for reliable results) which are called during content generation by LLMs. Ensure mandatory semantics rules (such as “the paylines must be within xxx range”) is enforced on LLM via prompt engineering in the prompt template for example, which triggers certain retrieval and/ or generation behaviour (e.g. metadata filtering and/ or adjust the generation content to fulfil the rules). Post-generation processing: Figure out how to best implement response quality checking (e.g., use Bedrock’s action groups or function calling to programmatically examine whether certain required information is generated, and further trigger LLMs to request users for input if needed via customizing prompt template for example). Maintain the history of a conversation if needed (e.g. via Converse API), so users can submit adjustment requirements via a dialogue manner.   What we ask of you: Experience of designing, developing and implementing LLMs based conversational AI products in cloud platforms, such as AWS Bedrock. Hands-on experience of RAG, LLM fine-tuning, advanced prompt engineering and handling LLM hallucinations Strong technical proficiency with Python, SQL and AWS. Able to write production quality code and have adequate version control skills. Strong understanding of DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines. Experience of closely working with data scientists and data engineers. If you feel great, you’ll do great.

The organization serves the Church worldwide to promote the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Samaritan's Purse Statement of Faith: We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God. (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17) We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; Ephesians 4:4-6) We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. (Matthew 1:23; John 1:1-4 and 1:29; Acts 1:11 and 2:22-24; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:1-4 and 4:15) We believe that all men everywhere are lost and face the judgment of God, that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation, and that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit. (Luke 24:46-47; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:23; 2 Corinthians 5:10-11; Ephesians 1:7 and 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7) We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling enables the Christian to live a godly life. (John 3:5-8; Acts 1:8 and 4:31; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:6-10) We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment.

(Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15; 1 Peter 3:15) We believe Gods plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made to complete each other. God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9) We believe that we must dedicate ourselves to prayer, to the service of our Lord, to His authority over our lives, and to the ministry of evangelism.

(Psalm 139:13; Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5; Matthew 22:37-39; Romans 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10) We believe that God wonderfully and immutably creates each person biological male or female. These two distinct but complementary sexes together reflect the image and likeness of God. Rejection of ones biological sex is a rejection of Gods merciful design and creative order.
